# Chapter 1. Introduction

We delve into the realm of software architecture to understand how the 
larger parts of systems fit together, along with numerous trade-offs.

Software Architects must understand and analyze systems deeply, in all their
complexity, and must make important trade-off decisions, sometimes with 
incomplete information.

Software architects make the kind of decisions that AI cannot, evaluating 
trade-offs within complex, changing contexts.

Architecture can only be understood in context. Architects base their decisions
on the realities of their environment. All architectures are product of their
context.

# Defining Software Architecture

Let's say that software architecture has four dimensions:
- Style
- Characteristics
- Logical Components
- Decisions

The software architecture of a system consists of an architectural style as
the starting point, combined with the architecture characteristics it must 
support, the logical components to implement its behaviour, and the 
architecture decisions justifying it all.

## Architecture Characteristics

Architecture Characteristics define the capabilities (-ilities) of a system.
In short, what the system should do. 
Architecture Characteristics:
- Availability
- Scalability
- Fault Tolerance
- Performance
- Reliability
- Security
- Elasticity
- Deployability
- Testability
- Agility
- Recoverability
- Learnability


## Logical Components
Logical Components define its behaviour. Designing logical components is one 
key task for an architect.


## Architectural Style
Once an architect has analyzed the architectural characteristics and logical 
components the system needs then they know enough to choose an appropriate  
architecture style as a starting point for implementing the system.


## Architecture Decisions
The fourth dimension that define software architecture is Architecture 
Decisions, which defines the rules for how a system should be constructed. 
Architecture Decisions forms the constraints of the system and direct the 
development teams on what is and what isn't allowed.
