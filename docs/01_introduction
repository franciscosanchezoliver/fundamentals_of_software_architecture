# Chapter 1. Introduction

We delve into the realm of software architecture to understand how the 
larger parts of systems fit together, along with numerous trade-offs.

Software Architects must understand and analyze systems deeply, in all their
complexity, and must make important trade-off decisions, sometimes with 
incomplete information.

Software architects make the kind of decisions that AI cannot, evaluating 
trade-offs within complex, changing contexts.

Architecture can only be understood in context. Architects base their decisions
on the realities of their environment. All architectures are product of their
context.
